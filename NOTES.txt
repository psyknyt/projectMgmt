    || I created ||

    >: side bar and NewProject component along with noProject component managed these two with state management.  ||
    >: Tried adding validation with the help of lifting state from handleSave i.e. NewProject component to the  Input component to show the invalidity of the values enterd.
        till now I have created an #alert for any input value that is null(== "").

:> I added the functionality of adding new projects in our state.

:> Implemented Create portal in which we used the element with ("modal-doot") id in our index.html
and used backdrop tailwind class to add a backdrop.

:> The portal displays the model and whenever the user inputs are empty the modal appears,
the model appearnce happens with the help of ref which is being passed to the Modal
the userImerativeHadndle adds another function to the ref passed and that fucntion
is called whenever the input is wrong.

// I applied the context api in this react app now I think adding backend to this project will be my job 
   I learned about context api in this project and applied it as well without watching any tutorials all by myself...
   It was a great experience cos I have no mentor and I just did all debugging by myself
   learned about react browser debugging tools, which helped me to identify the bug in my app which kept me wounding for days...
