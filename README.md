# projectMgmt

On DAY-1          ||          11/30/2023  
    || I created || 
    >: side bar and NewProject component along with noProject component managed these two with state management.  || 
     >: Tried adding validation with the help of lifting state from handleSave i.e. NewProject component to the  Input component to show the invalidity of the values enterd.
        till now I have created an #alert for any input value that is null(== ""). ||
